  Created largely to overcome difficulties I was having with tourretes and being able 
  to properly use my mouse and keyboard, TapTap Remote provides users the ability to 
  control their desktop PC via their phone.

  Securely pairing your phone to the desktop service enables you to use your phone as 
  both a wireless trackpad and keyboard.
