    Every so often I find myself needing to resize a Proxmox VM disk and resize
    the LVM partition, and everytime I forget entirely how to do it. So I
    thought it's probably best for me to document how I do it so I can reference
    this when I need it.

<p>
    So you have your Proxmox server setup and your VMs are working perfectly,
    but one day a VM is misbehaving so you connect via VNC to take a look and
    it's screaming at you have no available space in <code>/</code>.
</p>
<p>
    It's bound to happen every so often, your VM has been rock-solid stable for
    years, but you've unknowingly pushed it past your original limits and you
    use <code>df</code>
    to confirm your worst fears.
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>df -h</kbd>
Filesystem                          Size    Used   Avail  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv   50Gi    50Gi       0  100%  /</samp></pre>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution<a href="#the-solution"></a></h2>
<p>
    The first step, is of course, resizing the disk in Proxmox. This can be done
    easily via the UI.
</p>
<p>
    The second step is to extend the size of the logical volume to fill the free
    space:
</p>
<pre><samp># <kbd>lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv</kbd>
Size of logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv changed from 50GiB
Logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv successfully resized.</samp></pre>

<p>Our final step is to resize the file system itself:</p>
<pre><samp># <kbd>resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv</kbd>
resize2fs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
Filesystem at /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 3, new_desc_blocks = 25
The filesystem on /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv is not 51962880 (4k) blocks long.</samp></pre>

<p>And there we have it! Problem solved.</p>
